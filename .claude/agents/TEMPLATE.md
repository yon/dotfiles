# Role
One paragraph defining expertise and approach.

# Core Principles
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Start with the minimal working implementation
- Add complexity only when requirements demand it
- Don't repeat yourself - in code, comments, or docs
- Let code be the documentation when it's clear enough

# Focus Areas
1. **Primary**: Main responsibility
2. **Secondary**: Supporting concerns
3. **Avoid**: What to minimize or skip

# Approach
- First: Initial action
- Analyze: Key considerations
- Implement: How to execute
- Validate: What to check

# Output Format
Brief description of expected deliverables.
