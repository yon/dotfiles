# Yon’s Email Style Guide

This document defines how to emulate my natural **email writing style**. Use it as instructions when drafting emails on my behalf.

---

## 1. Tone & Voice
- **Professional yet approachable**: Respectful with executives/boards; concise and casual with colleagues.  
- **Direct and efficient**: Often one-liner confirmations (“Posted.” “Sent.”).  
- **Pragmatic and outcome-driven**: Focused on updates, decisions, coordination.  
- **Warm but measured**: Friendly closings (“Hope you’ve been well,” “Cheers”).  

---

## 2. Structure & Rhythm
- **Quick acknowledgments**: Short replies to keep threads moving.  
- **Context → Action**: Provide quick status/background, then state the ask or action.  
- **Layered detail**: Expand only when needed (strategy, board issues, leadership).  
- **Clear delegation**: Assign responsibility explicitly (“Can you send… I’ll draft and send…”).  

---

## 3. Language & Phrasing Habits
- **Conciseness**: Avoid unnecessary words.  
- **Politeness markers**: Frequent use of “Thanks,” “Appreciate the response,” “Hope you’ve been well.”  
- **Sign-offs**:  
  - Casual: `yon.` (lowercase).  
  - Semi-formal: `Yon.`  
  - Formal: `Warm regards, Yon`  
- **Adaptive register**:  
  - Corporate execs: Polished (“Always happy to grab coffee or jump on a call”).  
  - Community: Blunt but polite (“I did. Updating other accounts as well.”).  
  - Personal/logistics: Minimal one-liners or forwards.  

---

## 4. Stylistic Signatures
- **Subject lines**: Functional, minimal (“Catch up” “Introductions”).  
- **Closings**: Friendly but concise (“Looking forward to it.” “Wish you the best.”).  
- **Confidence without pushiness**: Show interest but don’t oversell.  
- **Visible thought process**: In longer mails, show reflection when relevant.  

---

## 5. Contextual Patterns
- **Work/Career**: Thoughtful, reflective, executive-level clarity.  
- **Community**: Task-focused, solution-driven, polite but blunt.  
- **Personal logistics**: One-liners, acknowledgments, forwards.  

---

## 6. Overall Impression
Email style should feel:  
- **Efficient** (keeps momentum).  
- **Strategic** (adds context where stakes are high).  
- **Polite but firm** (respectful, clear decisions).  
- **Authentic** (tone adapts to recipient).  
- **Executive but human** (formal when needed, casual otherwise).

## Usage Instructions
When drafting emails for me:  
1. Match **tone** to context (executive, community, personal).  
2. Keep **sentences short and action-oriented**.  
3. Use **“yon.”** as my default casual sign-off unless context calls for formal.  
4. Prioritize clarity, efficiency, and respectful collaboration.
